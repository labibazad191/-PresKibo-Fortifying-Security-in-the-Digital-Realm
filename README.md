## 1. Login Verification Security Measures

Implemented various security measures for login verification, including:
- Password Hashing using SHA3-256.
- Secure Session Handling.
- User Agent Detection for basic device logging.
- Email Notifications with Timestamp on successful login.
- Error Reporting enabled for development, with precautions for production.
- SQL Injection Prevention using Parameterized Queries.
- Redirection after Successful Login for a secure user experience.

## 2. Database Backup Script Security Enhancements

Enhanced security in the database backup script with the following measures:
- Refactored code for external configuration of sensitive information.
- Implemented input validation and sanitization to prevent potential SQL injection.
- Ensured secure backup path and directory permissions.
- Added logging for errors and important events.
- Enforced access controls to restrict unauthorized access.
- Emphasized the importance of using HTTPS for secure communication.

## 3. Overall Application Security

Implemented a comprehensive set of security measures, including:
- Secure Session Management.
- Use of PDO for SQL Injection Prevention.
- Password Hashing with SHA3-256.
- Input Validation on the server-side.
- HTTPS Enforcement.
- Content Security Policy (CSP) considerations.
- Least Privilege Principle.
- Regular Server and Database Config Reviews.
- Vulnerability Testing.

## 4. Form Handling Security

Ensured secure form handling to prevent SQL injection, including:
- Use of Parameterized Queries for database interactions.
- Input Validation on the server-side.
- Sanitization and escape of user inputs.

## 5. Session and SQL Injection Prevention

Enhanced session security, implemented SQL injection prevention, and considered Content Security Policy (CSP).

## 6. Privacy-Enhancing Functions

Implemented a privacy-enhancing function for masking email addresses.

## 7. Email Functionality and Library Addition

Added the PHPMailer library for secure email functionality.

## 8. Database Security Measures

Implemented security measures for the database, including:
- Password Hashing for doctor accounts.
- Use of Parameterized Queries for SQL injection prevention.
- Limited database user permissions.
- Regular Database Backups.
- Keeping the database management system and PHP up to date.
- Emphasis on secure connections (HTTPS) for database communication.

## 9. Daily Database Autobackup

Enhanced daily database autobackup with the following measures:
- Proper data validation and input sanitization.
- Password security with hashed storage.
- Validation and securing of external dependencies.
- User access controls enforcement.
- Regular updates and secure database backups.
- Consideration of SSL/TLS encryption for database connections.
- Review and improvement of overall data consistency and integrity.
- Optimization of query performance with proper indexing.
